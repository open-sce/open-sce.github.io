    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this charter is to establish guidelines and principles for the OpenSCE open-source community. This community aims to foster collaboration, innovation, and the development of high-quality open-source projects to deliver a collection of tools and applications which enable more efficient workflows for statistical programming organizations to deliver quality statistical analyses for regulatory submissions, interfacing with the Domino Data Lab platform and other technologies. By promoting transparency, inclusivity, and shared ownership, we strive to create a vibrant and welcoming environment for individuals passionate about open-source software and driving positive change through data science and statistical programming in pharmaceutical research and development.</p>
<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

We strive to build a culture of respect, trust, and effective communication to maximize the potential of collaborative efforts.</p>
<h3 id="inclusivity">Inclusivity</h3>
<p>We are committed to fostering an inclusive community that welcomes and respects individuals from all backgrounds and identities. We reject discrimination, harassment, and any form of harmful behavior. We actively encourage diverse participation and seek to provide equal opportunities for everyone to contribute and thrive.</p>
<h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3>
